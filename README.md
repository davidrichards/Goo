Goo
===

Goo started as an insomnia-induced mixture of a few things:

* Are Your Lights On? by Gerald Weinberg, a classic book about understanding the nature of a problem and responding accordingly.
* Systems Thinking by Jamshid Gharajedaghi, an up-to-date systems book discussing things like mechancial, biological, and sociocultural models.
* REAMDE by Neal Stephenson, a computer/gaming thriller about what would happen when computer life breaches real life.

So, I started noodling with some throw-away code most of the night, since I couldn't sleep, building models with flexible callback systems.  What's emerging are some ideas about modeling that could be kind of fun to play with.


Contributing to Goo
===================
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
